### For Use Case 2 (UC2) we provide
  - the RDF Graph converted directly from the BMS (SIB-Bauwerke) data (BMS_SIB_Graph_UC2.ttl)
  - the spatial RDF Graph, containing the spatial representation and interlinking of bridge components and damage objects, linked to the BMS data graph (SpatialBridgeGraph_UC2)


### For Use Case 1 (UC1) we provide
  - the spatial RDF Graph, containing the spatial representation and interlinking of bridge components and damage objects (SpatialBridgeGraph_UC1)
  The BMS data of UC1 is confidential.

### Acknowledgements
We thank the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) and the Autobahn GmbH Südbayern to provide us the data for UC2.
The data of UC1 is part of the research project "SPP 100+ - Raumlink" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project number 501812634.
